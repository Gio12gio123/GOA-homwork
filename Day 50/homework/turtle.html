<h1>üê¢ Sea Turtles: Ancient Mariner Majesties</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Sea turtles are remarkable reptiles that have existed for over 100 million years. They are known for their long migrations and unique adaptations to marine life.</p>

<h2>Species Spotlight</h2>
<ul>
    <li class="species">
        <strong>Loggerhead Turtle</strong> (<em>Caretta caretta</em>): Recognizable by their large heads and strong jaws, they mainly feed on jellyfish and conchs.
    </li>
    <li class="species">
        <strong>Green Turtle</strong> (<em>Chelonia mydas</em>): Named for their greenish fat, they are primarily herbivorous, grazing on seagrasses and algae.
    </li>
    <li class="species">
        <strong>Leatherback Turtle</strong> (<em>Dermochelys coriacea</em>): The largest of all sea turtles, they can dive to incredible depths in search of jellyfish.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Habitat</h2>
<p>Sea turtles inhabit oceans worldwide, favoring tropical and subtropical waters. They often return to the beaches where they were born to lay eggs.</p>

<h2>Life Cycle</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Nesting</strong>: Females come ashore to lay eggs in sandy nests.</li>
    <li><strong>Hatching</strong>: Hatchlings emerge after about 60 days, instinctively heading toward the ocean.</li>
    <li><strong>Juveniles</strong>: Spend years in the ocean, maturing and growing.</li>
    <li><strong>Maturity</strong>: They reach reproductive age between 20-50 years, depending on the species.</li>
</ol>
